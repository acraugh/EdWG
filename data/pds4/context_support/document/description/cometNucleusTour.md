# COmet Nucleus TOUR (CONTOUR) Mission - Overview

The Comet Nucleus Tour, or CONTOUR, mission was part of NASA's Discovery
program. It launched from Cape Canaveral on
July 3, 2002. It was lost six weeks later, on August 15, 2002, when the 
spacecraft broke up during the burn that was intended to send it into
a heliocentric orbit. No data were returned prior to spacecraft loss.

The primary mission would have included flybys of two Jupiter-family
comets: 2P/Encke and
73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. A flyby of 6P/d'Arrest was planned for an
extended mission.

The goal of the mission was to investigate two very different comets.
2P/Encke is considered very "evolved", and has been in a stable orbit 
for thousands of years. 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, on the other hand, 
had experienced a breakup of its nucleus into three pieces in 1995.

The spacecraft carried four instruments
- CONTOUR Remote Imager/Spectrograph (CRISP)
- Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS)
- Comet Impact Dust Analyzer (CIDA)
- CONTOUR Forward Imager (CFI)

Because of the early loss of the spacecraft, no data were returned 
by this mission.
