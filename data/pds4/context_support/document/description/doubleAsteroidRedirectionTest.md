# Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Mission

## Overview

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission was a technology demonstration mission funded by NASA to send a kinetic impactor into the smaller component of a double asteroid system and measure the effect on the target's orbit about its primary. The target of the mission was (65803) Didymos and its satellite, Dimorphos. 

The DART spacecraft was the impactor and carried a single instrument, the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for OpNav (DRACO). The NASA-funded mission included a groundbased component comprising several  observatories that characterized the Didymos system before and after the impact to measure the effects on the period of Dimorphos to within 7.3 seconds. 

In addition, the Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) rode along 
on the DART  spacecraft and was released ten days prior to impact to observe the 
event *in situ*.
