# International Sun-Earth Explorer 3/International Cometary Explorer Mission - Summary

## Mission Overview
The effective launch of ICE took place on 22 December 1983.  As the spacecraft distance from Earth 
increased, tracking and data acquisition involved the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).  The necessity
for this involvement is apparent if one considers that the ISEE-3 radio system was designed to 
transmit from the halo orbit at a geocentric distance of 0.01 AU, whereas the distance to the 
spacecraft at cometary encounter will be 0.47 AU. A major effort required for the ICE mission 
was the outfitting of antennas in the DSN to operate at the ICE frequencies.  Current plans are 
to utilize the 64 m DSN (Goldstone, Madrid, Canberra) and the 300 m dish at Arecibo as the prime 
station.  The anticipated data rate at encounter will be 1024 bit/s, although 512 bit/s may be 
used at other times.  The acceptable performance is based on a bit error rate of 10**-4.  There 
will be additional coverage by the 64 m station at Usuda, Japan. Operations outside the month c
entered on the encounter date of 11 September 1985 are basically cruise-science measurements, 
which will be discussed in the next section.  The ICE spacecraft will be approaching the aim 
point on the main plasma tail axis 10000 km from the nucleus.  Some idea of the spatial scales 
associated with key instruments and their sampling times is given below for the expected data 
rate of 1024 bit/s.

For the sampling period indicated, the ‘spatial resolution’ is the distance travelled at the 
relative encounter speed of 20.7 km/s.  These dimensions should be compared with the estimated 
distance between bow-shock crossings of about 175 000 km and a measured main tail diameter of 
5000 km.  Expressed in terms of time, we expect the spacecraft to be inside the bow shock for 
about 2 h 20 min and in the main plasma tail for about 4 min. The magnetometer will produce 
many measurements during the encounter period and we use it to illustrate possible scientific 
product.  Current models of comets do not indicate a major amplification of the cometary magnetic 
field over the solar-wind value.  However, major changes in field-line direction are expected.  
Well away from the comet the magnetic field should, on average, show the Archimedean spiral 
angle of 135deg or 315deg to the radial appropriate for normal solar-wind flow.  Interior to 
the bow shock we expect a different, possibly somewhat chaotic, orientation tending to the 
ordered two-lobed configuration along the axis of the plasma tail. If the neutral sheet is 
encountered, a magnetic reversal should be recorded.  The model-dependent nature of this 
description must be stressed.  For example, the bow shock may or may not exist.  We should 
know after 11 September 1985, and the model will be tested in this and in other respects. 
Obviously, we need data from as many different experiments as possible to complete our model 
testing.  To enhance the science return from the encounter, a Guest Investigator Program was 
established by NASA.

## Mission Objectives Overview

The third International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE-3) was launched on 12 August 1978 as one 
element of a three-spacecraft mission that began in 1977.  The original purpose was to study 
the solar-wind interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.  The spacecraft was maintained in 
a ‘halo orbit’ about the libration point, L1, where it monitored the solar-wind input.  It 
completed four years of uninterrupted operation at that location.  Several opportunities to 
use ISEE-3 in an extended mission phase were available.  Among the most attractive 
scientifically were exploration of the distant geotail and an intercept of periodic 
Comet Giacobini-Zinner.  Either or both of these options were available.  The comet option 
was constrained to an intercept of Giacobini-Zinner in September 1985; specifically, an 
intercept of Comet Halley was not possible.  In order to explore the comet option, a 
subcommittee of the ISEE Science Working Team (SWT) was formed at the request of the ISEE-3 
Project Scientist, T.  von Rosenvinge, and chaired by E. Smith.  The subcommittee and the 
SWT as a whole found the option to be of considerable scientific interest, and a report 
entitled Intercept of Giacobini-Zinner by ISEE was issued in June 1982, and revised in 
May 1983.  An ad hoc subcommittee of the Space Science Board recommended that NASA proceed 
with both the geotail option and the comet intercept.  After an in-house review and a review 
of the readiness of the spacecraft to perform the intercept by the Goddard Space Flight 
Center, NASA approved the intercept with Comet Giacobini-Zinner.  The maneuvers necessary 
to achieve the trajectory that would send the spacecraft into the distant geomagnetic tail 
and to an intercept of Comet Giacobini-Zinner were not simple.  They were the brainchild 
of R.  Farquhar, Flight Director for the Project.  Basically, five gravitational encounters 
with the Moon were required to change the spacecraft's orbit.  The last encounter was on 
22 December 1983 when the spacecraft made a close swingby, passing only 120 km above the 
lunar surface.  This maneuver effectively ‘launched’ the spacecraft from the Earth-Moon 
system.  At the same time, the spacecraft was renamed the International Cometary Explorer 
(ICE) to correspond to its new mission.

## Additional Note

In addition to the encounter with Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, ICE also made observations 
of the solar wind upstream of Comet 1P/Halley. NASA ended operations and support for the 
ICE mission on 5 May 1997, but an independent, publicly funded project signed an agreement 
with NASA to attempt to reclaim the spacecraft as it passed by Earth in 2014. One thruster 
firing in July 2014 was successful, but a second firing failed (likely a lack of nitrogen). 
The spacecraft is still in a heliocentric orbit and is expected to return to the vicinity 
of Earth in 2031.
