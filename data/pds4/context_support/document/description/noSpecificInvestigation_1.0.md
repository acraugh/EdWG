# No Specific Investigation Description

The “No Specific Investigation” context product is referenced in those 
very rare cases where data are not relevant to a single (or small number) 
of funded or otherwise organized programs, campaigns, missions, or community 
efforts. 

It is most frequently used in formulating test labels where an investigation 
is required, but the specific investigation involved has no effect on the 
label content or circumstances of the test.
